## Description

This application is a full-stack application designed to find nearby taco restaurants in Houston, TX. The user can search by their address or zip code to find restaurants near them as well as filter the results by name, distance, and rating. If user allows location access, the map will automatically render in their current location. An interactive map shows the restaurants listed on the map with markers. When a marker is clicked, the window scrolls to which restaurant it is on the left hand side. When a user clicks on a restaurant, a new page is rendered with restaurant information. This page also allows for users to rate restaurants. Because of the nature of the targeted users, this app is designed to be very mobile responsive and fully functional on even the smallest screens.
